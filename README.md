Logix
==========

Logix is a simple registration and login system that I decided to build as my weekend project.

Logix exposes server side APIs written using PHP while interacting with a MySQL database to 
store newly registered users and login them in from an android application.The server sends data to the 
application in JSON format.

The application itself is very simple;all it does is enabling a registered user to log in and display
a little bit information about them. It also supports registration.


Note
===========
This project misses few things which aren't a big deal and I am too lazy to fix them.
Also the code misses few key comments. I will try to find time to patch it up, otherwise contact me 
if you're stuck somewhere.
